# Solving the Traveling Salesman Problem using Q-Learning


This repository explores a simple approach to applying a Q Learning algorithm to solve the 
Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). Results and details are presented in a jupyter notebook `TSP.ipynb`.
Python 3.8.5.


## Requirements

`Python 3.8.5` is used. Requirements needed : `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Data

The algorithm is tested on a few instances in `data` these were downloaded [here](https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/datasets/tsp/tsp.html).
